<h2>:arrow_right:Contribution Guide:</h2>
:point_right:You must fork the repo.      

:point_right:After doing `npm start`, create your account on the website and be familiar with the interface.   

:point_right:You are adviced to make your own branch for contributing.     

:point_right:Now you can either create an issue to request some changes or adding features or improving styling.   

:point_right:You can also work on already created issues, but first comment on that issue, so that you get assigned the label of `gssoc23` and start working that issue and once you complete, you can raise a pull request.     

:point_right:Once I review your code and if it seems okay then your branch will be merged.   

:point_right:Bonus Tip: If you are new to GitHub and using terminal does no suit you, then you can use <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a>.
